audacious-usf-plugin
====================

The USF plugin (N64) for audacious

# About the plugin

The plugin was removed sometime in 2012 (i think) from the [audacious-plugins](https://github.com/audacious-media-player/audacious-plugins) repo. 

Then lucashpandolfo forked and restored the plugin (https://github.com/lucashpandolfo/audacious-plugins).

It was further forked and made compatible with Audacious 3.8 onwards by Sascha Klick in 2018 (https://github.com/saschaklick/audacious-usf-plugin).

# Installation

```bash
> ./autogen.sh
> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install
```
